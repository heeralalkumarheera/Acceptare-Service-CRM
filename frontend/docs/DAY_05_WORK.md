# Day 5 – Reusable UI Components & Service Layer

## Objective
To build reusable UI components and create a service layer for API communication in the CRM frontend.

## Work Done Today

### 1. Reusable UI Components
- Created a **Button** component for common actions.
- Created an **Input** component for form fields.
- Created a **Card** component for structured UI layout.
- Ensured components are reusable and configurable via props.

### 2. Service Layer Setup
- Created a centralized **API service file** for handling HTTP requests.
- Added **auth service** for authentication-related API calls.
- Separated business logic from UI components.

### 3. Code Structure Improvements
- Organized components inside `src/components`.
- Organized services inside `src/services`.
- Improved project readability and scalability.

## Outcome
- UI consistency improved across the application.
- Cleaner and maintainable frontend architecture.
- Ready base for integrating backend APIs.
